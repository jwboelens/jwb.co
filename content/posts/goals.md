Here is a list of things I want to do in Q3 2022, that's July, Augustus and September.

- Less Netflix / HBO Max / YouTube / Disney+
- More Spotify / music in general
- More cycling km's (need to fix my road bike...)
- Read 10 books
- No alcohol (already doing that, but keep it going!)
- Go camping at least once
- Walk 100k (in total, progress <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ekTR5Fu0fZgu2r6m3MX-p66WwCV9AbRko_9VqYQdv6w/edit?usp=sharing"> here</a>)
- Screentime below 1 hour a day
