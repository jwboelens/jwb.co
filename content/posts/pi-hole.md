I’ve setup a Raspberry Pi with Pi-Hole two weeks ago, to see if I could get rid off the enormous amount of ads on the internet these days.

Results so far:

- 3,364 queries
- 2,210 queries blocked
- 62.7% blocked

Especially on my phone and tablet I am really happy with it. Websites don’t only load way faster, they also look way better without the ads.
