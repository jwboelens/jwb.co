👋 Hi!

Welcome at my new website: jwb.co

The last couple of months (years…?) I’ve dabbled with building a personal website. Do I need a website? Nope. But I like to build and design stuff. For my job this is what I do a lot, but having something personal on the web is new for me. I don’t have any social media accounts (I hate Facebook and Twitter), so having a place to put something online is nice. And what better place than my own website.
Hello Hugo

I’ve build websites with I think every CMS available out there. The problem with all of them: bloat. Sure Wordpress is great, I’ve build a lot of things with it. But for a simple personal website, I feel like it’s too much.

Static Site Generators are hip these days. All the hip kids are making websites with them. I’ve never understood them really, but I’ve decided to give Hugo a try.

Installing Hugo and building this website took about an hour. The documentation is useless, but the forum is great.

This complete website is 64kb. That’s amazing.

It’s hosted on Digital Ocean with support from ServerPilot.
