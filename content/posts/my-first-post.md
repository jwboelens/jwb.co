Apple’s Messages app was gulping juice, faster than a swarm of migrating Monarch butterflies on a can of Dr. Pepper. Not only had it been consuming power all night, it was still hogging CPU cycles the next morning, and was somehow preventing sleep.

I’m not sure what the 12hr power number means if not battery percentage, keeping in mind the battery level dropped ~70% and the number shown here says 20.78. It does give a good overview of which apps use the most battery over the last 12 hours.

You know what’s great about renaming apps to generic names, like iMessage to Messages? It makes it next to impossible to find people discussing the same issue, or fixes. And Apple’s official forums are flooded with pretenders who post the most generic and irrelevant responses I’ve ever seen, in what I can only imagine is an attempt at resume padding or zealous worship.

Anyway, the only real suggestion I found is to delete all links and animated GIFs from your conversations. I only deleted links, and while it did put a stop to the insane power drain, it was tedious, and I can only imagine how big of a hassle it would be if you have years of messages1. And selecting multiple links is a feature exclusive to the iOS app — but you have to select each one. There is no select all.
